# openshift-resources

## Main purposes of this repository

- To serve educational goals
- To store working **ocs** ("Openshift Code Snippets") that could be easily reused as building blocks for larger deployment scenarios
- To draw attention to some of the complexities or implementation challenges that can be faced while deploying such tools as ELK (and others...) in Openshift.
